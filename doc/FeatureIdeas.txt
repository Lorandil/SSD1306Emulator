---------
* try different video modes (e.g. 640x480@256colors)
* support background image as a frame
* aspect ratio support/correction
* screenshot to SD card function
* mirror mode/passthrough mode: output all received data to second i2c interface
* add different render modes, 
  * scan lines
  * vignette
  * film grain
  * analog noise
  * analog distortions
  * ...

Hardware:
---------
* add a (solid state) relay to power on the I2C master after the PI pico is ready

TinyJoypad:
-----------
* Create custom PCB with module slot and DIP8 socket - does it work to just enable Vcc on one
  of both ATTinys, perhaps using a mechanical switch? I will try!
* Integrate the custom PCB into a VCS2600 console case (or an NES or a toaster or ...)
